				<h3>John Legend kicking off new virtual reality concert series</h3>
				<div class="blog-meta">by Alan Smith in Music</div>
				<p>John Legend is heading back to work to deliver a special immersive virtual reality performance in an empty Los Angeles studio.<br>

					The All of Me hitmaker has been putting on mini-gigs and shooting episodes of U.S. talent competition The Voice, on which he serves as a judge, from his home
					 while in coronavirus isolation, but on Saturday (16May20), he will headline the new Live from LA concert series.<br>
					
					Using modern technology, Legend will hit the stage in a specially-designed studio for the show, which will enable viewers to virtually attend the event, making them feel like they are in the same room without ever stepping outside.
					The free show, staged in collaboration with bosses at virtual reality music platform MelodyVR, will kick off at 6pm PST via the company's app (on.melodyvr.com/App).<br>
					
					"Come and join me for a very special performance live from MelodyVR's studio on Saturday, May 16," Legend shares in a statement. "While we can't be together in person right now, I'm excited to share this moment with my fans." </p>

				<h3>Katy Perry promises 'inspirational anthems' for new summer album</h3>
				<div class="blog-meta">by <a href="">Alan Smith</a> in <a href="">Music</a></div>
				<p>Katy Perry has no plans to stall the release of her "uplifting" sixth album due to the impending birth of her daughter.
					The 35-year-old singer dropped Daisies, the lead single from her new record, on Friday, and confirmed an album is set to follow in the next few months.<br><br>
					
					"I have this body of work and there was a question of, do I wait until next year? And I was like, one thing is for certain, I'm having a child this summer," the Firework hitmaker said in an interview with New Music Daily on Apple Music.
					
					"My whole life is about to change and I'm sure I will have a whole new access to different emotions I never had, and will be able to write from, so I'm going to write a whole other record probably when that happens," she added, noting that her fans would want "uplifting" music to help them through the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
					
					"I just think that this summer people want music, they want to dance. They might want some uplifting, inspirational anthems. And I like being associated with those," the pregnant American Idol judge continued.</p>

				<h3>Michael Buble's family hit with death threats following Instagram Live controversy </h3>
				<div class="blog-meta">by <a href="">Alan Smith</a> in <a href="">Music</a></div>
				<p>Michael Buble and his wife were targeted by angry fans after a video showing the singer nudging his wife with his elbow during an Instagram Live chat sparked controversy.

					The Canadian crooner appeared alongside Luisana Lopilato on the social media site to chat to fans back in April, and many were left concerned when he appeared to interrupt and grab her, and the singer's representative put out a statement calling the controversy "a failed effort of cyber bullying".<br>
					
					Speaking on Argentinian TV show Intrusos, Luisana revealed that while the loved-up pair received a lot of support over stories surrounding the event, there was a lot of hate too.<br>
					
					"We received a lot of love from people but you wouldn't believe the amount of people who sent me photos with weapons saying they were going to kill Mike when he reached Argentina, photos of knives from people laughing and saying they were going to cut off his fingers, leave a bomb for us or give him a beating," she said, adding, "It made me afraid and I still feel a little bit frightened."<br>
					
					Luisana added: "It's not nice to receive death threats. There were a lot of threats. The positive messages we received outnumbered them but I am worried for my family. I suffered a lot with what happened."</p>
